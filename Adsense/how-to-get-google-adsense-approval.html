                When I initially applied for AdSense approval, I had 20 pages uploaded on my website, but unfortunately,
                it
                was rejected due to low-value content. Determined to improve, I diligently worked on creating an
                additional
                10 posts within a few days. With an enhanced website, I reapplied for the AdSense approval program and
                was
                successfully accepted. Since then, I have been leveraging my knowledge and experience in this field to
                teach
                beginners the proven methods for achieving AdSense approval.
            </p>
            <p>If you have over 30 pages but still face the "Low Value Content" issue during AdSense approval, check for
                violations of other terms like copyrighted content, non-valuable or unstructured content. Ensure your
                website adheres to all AdSense guidelines to increase approval chances. Improve content quality and
                value to
                strengthen your case for approval.

            <h2 id="head-ahref6"> Minimum Traffic/Views For Adsense Approval</h2>
            <br>
            <a href="#"><img src="Approval/pic6.JPG" alt="minimum traffic/views for adsense approval" class="imgA"></a>
            <p> I believe that having a minimum of 1,000+ page views per month can greatly benefit your
                chances of AdSense approval. When I started this site, I had roughly 5-10 views per day.
                Slowly and Gradually, My posts begin to showup and rank higher and so did my views too.
                However, it is important to note that traffic is just one aspect considered by
                Google. The effort you put into continuously improving your website and actively contributing to it,
                even if
                you initially have only around 10 page views, can positively influence your prospects of AdSense
                approval in
                the beginning stages.</p>
            <p id="head-ahref6.1">Remember, the journey towards AdSense approval requires perseverance. By steadily increasing your traffic
                and
                continuously contributing to your website, you can enhance your chances of AdSense approval from your
                perspective. Emphasize the value you bring to your visitors, and with consistent effort, you can create
                a
                compelling case for AdSense approval.</p>

            <br>
            <a href="#"><img src="Approval/pic7.JPG" alt="low value content adsense solve fix" class="imgA"></a>
            <p>There are several important policy violations that can prevent a beginner from
                obtaining AdSense approval for his/her website. Some of the key violations to be
                mindful of include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>Insufficient content: Having a website with thin or inadequate content can hinder AdSense
                        approval. It is crucial to create substantial and valuable content that offers relevant
                        information to your audience.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Unstructured or difficult-to-navigate website: A website with poor structure, broken links, or a
                        confusing user interface can negatively impact the user experience and may hinder AdSense
                        approval.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Copyrighted content: Using content, images, or media that infringe upon someone else's
                        intellectual property rights can lead to rejection. Ensure that all the content on your website
                        is original or properly attributed to the rightful owner.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Adult content or restricted material: Websites that contain adult content, promote violence, or
                        offer restricted products or services may not be eligible for AdSense approval.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Deceptive software downloads: Websites that promote or distribute deceptive software, malware, or
                        viruses will not be approved for AdSense. Users' safety and trust are of utmost importance.</p>
