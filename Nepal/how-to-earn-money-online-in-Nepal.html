        <p><b>How to earn money online in Nepal?</b>

            </p>
        <p>Buying and selling domains is a process of acquiring and transferring ownership of internet domain names. 
            One can buy a domain for less price and then sell it for more price.  
            It is one of the profitable side businesses as people can earn money through both buying and selling domains. 
        </p>
        <p> Second-hand domains may have existing backlinks, which can be beneficial for 
            SEO and can help to improve the visibility of a website. Selling a second-hand domain can be a way to generate income,

             domain is often less expensive than registering a new domain, and can provide an opportunity for a 
             buyer to acquire a valuable domain name at a lower cost.
