                <p>Mount Everest (Nepali: सगरमाथा) is Earth's highest mountain above sea level, located in the
                    Mahalangur Himal sub-range of the Himalayas. The China–Nepal border runs across its summit point.
                    Its elevation (snow height) of 8,848.86 Metres (29,031.7 ft) was most recently established in 2020
                    by the Chinese and Nepali authorities.
                    <br><br>
                    Mount Everest attracts many climbers, including highly experienced mountaineers. There are two main
                    climbing routes, one approaching the summit from the southeast in Nepal and the other from the north
                    in Tibet. While not posing substantial technical climbing
                    challenges on the standard route, Everest presents dangers such as altitude sickness, weather, and
                    wind, as well as hazards from avalanches and the Khumbu Icefall.
