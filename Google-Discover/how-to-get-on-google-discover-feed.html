            </p>

            <h2 id="head-ahref1">What is Google Discover?</h2>
            <br>
            <img src="pic5.jpg" alt="what is google discover">
            <p>Google Discover is a powerful scrollable and user based tool offered by Google that offers feeds based on
                individual interests & displayes the articles, videos & other content on Google Discover Tab on the

                screen passively. <br> <a href="/SEO-Google/Google-Discover.html" target="_blank">Learn More</a></p>

            </script>
                <p>In other words, Google Discover plays with user's search history, location and application activities
                to suggest the best possible feeds infront of them. For instance, One doesn't need to use their keyboard
                to search on browser rather the product or article gets recommended on Discove Feed automatically.
            </p>
            <p>To feed user's based content, Google gathers informations from other platforms like Facebook, YouTube,
                instagram
                to promote products through advertisements and generate revenue. The AI Bots of Google, searches on the
                web
                for the best possible result & suggests feeds to a user.
            </p>
            <p>Why Google Discove Feeds appear on Mobile Devices Only? - The reason for the question is that about
                2.65 Billion users use GoogleChrome as their primary browser. Among them 49% + users are mobile users.
                This is a huge number & Google obviously knows to interact to its users, and Google Discover
                Tab is targeted to these audience to interact with them.
            </p>
            <p>Since, Google Discover Feed targets interests rather than keywords, how can you get the chance to get
                your content appear on discover section?
            </p>
            <p>Talking in a general way, You need to publish your content focusing on your niche & targeting to
                some group of audience who finds it interesting & practical. Naturally, its almost impossible to
                engage everyone on your content but if your content is valid & suits some user searched interests, its
                more likely to appear on their discover feeds.

                    <script async
                    src="https://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js?client=ca-pub-1578967526186709"
                    crossorigin="anonymous"></script>

                    data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-1578967526186709" data-ad-slot="7870867148"></ins>
                <script>

                </script>
            </p>

                <h2 id="head-ahref5">3. Optimize For E-A-T</h2>
            
            <p>E-A-T stands for Expertise, Authoritativeness & Trustworthiness. In short, it is a factor that
                helps Google to allow or remove deceptive contents from getting indexed. It is a principle Google's

                should be ranked higher or not, E-A-T plays an important role.

            <p>Google recommends its creators to use high quality & wider images. According to a 
                study conducted by Google, Uploading large and quality images increase Click-Through-Rate(CTR)
             and derives more traffic to the website if compared to textual information only.  </p>
             <p>How large should an image be? - To increase chances on getting content on Discover, 
                 Google recommends atleast 1200px wide images with the meta tag of ( max-image-preview:large )
          You can use a high qualtiy image and 1200 px wide image but the image shouldn't feature 
          your website logo, this is prohibited by Google.
                </p>
<h2 id="head-ahref7">5. Publish High Quality Content</h2>

<p>High Quality Content automatically attracts potential users. Google is completely against palagiarism. 
    Copyrighted & poorly contents impact badly to the audience and can ruin their productive time. Therefore, 
    in order to display your content on google discover, quality content is mandatory. 
</p>
<p>A quality content is a researched and well managed form of informations arranged in sequence to make 
    users engaged . The main motto of having a quality content is to ensure good user experience on a page. 
    A site with quality content itself gets ranked and served at the frontmost part of the search or feed. 
    Keyword research, queries and their answers must be included in a content for better performance of the 
    posts.
</p>
<h2 id="head-ahref8">6. Avoid Clickbait Headlines</h2>

<p>Google refuses those posts which use clickbait headings. If the google bot notices that your heading doesn't 
    deliver or match with the article you posses on your page then it automatically rejects your posts before 
    appearing in discover feeds.
</p>
<p>Clickbait headings shouldn't be used but one can use catchy headings which address the main promise of the content 
    inside the posts. Just point out the main title which reveals your content rather than writing unwanted spam 
    headings. For example, if you've a news website, you can use headings based on your research and discoveries which 
    addresses the assense of your article.
</p>
<h2 id="head-ahref9">7. Consistency-Publish Regularly</h2>

<p>Google Discover is seeking for contents to display on discover feeds. For that one should publish his/her content 
    without delaying in a regular or timely basis. The contents which are fresh and uptodate are more likely to 
    get crawled by bots and featured on discover feeds as well. Be patience, and upload your articles in a consistent way 
    following all the guidelines and policies.
</p>
<p>If your content gets discovered on google discover feeds, then you've successfully passed all the tests 
    of Google and are ready to get served to your potential users. Make sure that you are regular and consistent with 
    high qulaity content as there is huge competition in the market to get visible in 1st section in feed.
</p>
<h2 id="head-ahref10">8. Track and Analyze Results</h2>

<p>Once your contents start appearing on google discover feeds, you can analyze the performance of your 
    served feeds from google search console or google analytics. A discover section is activated on your 
    search console where you'll be able to see all the performance level of your pages.
</p>

    is performing less. Try to compare them and figure out the reasons behind their success and failures. 
    Check CTR, impressions, which will help you gain more confidence to work on future projects.
