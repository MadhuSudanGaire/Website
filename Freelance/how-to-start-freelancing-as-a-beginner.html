            <p>Freelancing is a type of work model in which people offer their services to clients on a
                project-by-project
                basis but not being employed by a single company or boss. Freelancers are self-employed individuals who
                are responsible for finding their own clients, negotiating terms and rates, and managing their own
                finances.
            </p>
            <p>In other words, Freelancers aren't bound by any sorts of traditional employment agreements & have the
                freedom to
                choose their own projects they want to work on and whenever they want. They may work from anywhere &
                have the ability to
                set their own schedules. However, Freelancing can be risky as this independence also means that
                freelancers are responsible for
                their own benefits, such as healthcare and retirement savings, and must continuously find new clients
                and projects to maintain a balanced source of revenue.

<p>As I mentioned earlier, Freelancing is a way of working independently, rather than being employed by a company.
    They often work on a project-by-project basis, and they may have multiple clients at the same time which is one of the 
    best things about having a career in freelancing.
</p>
<p>Being a corporate employee can be boring for those who wants to be creative, and who are passionate to 
    upgrade their skills but in freelancing you are your own boss. You can cheer up yourself whenever you want 
    . Not only this, one can choose freelancing as a good career option, wither it can be being a content creator or 
    graphics designer. 
</p>
<p>Yeah, it can be frustating at the beginning but once you set your skills and able to perform your best 
    , you can achieve a lot more than you expect as a corporate employee. Being able to recognize your passion is 
    the key to victory to become a freelancer. As we already knew variety of ideas about online freelancing, offline 
    freelancing is almost the same. Just the difference is you will be working the work you love in real/offline world.

</p>
<p>If you're willing to make your offline presence bolder than pursuing an offline freelancing work can be your 
    best choice.  It can also be a good option for people who prefer to work in person, rather than remotely.
     For example, it may be more difficult for you to find clients if you're not actively promoting your services online. 
    Additionally, you may need to be more flexible with your schedule in order to meet with clients in person.

    but here are a few that might be of interest:
</p>
<ul>
    <li><p>If you're really passionate about freelancing, then you must be ready to invest your time 
        and put yourself locked for long hours in order to meet deadlines and complete projects on time.
    </p></li>
    <li><p>Freelancers don't have a regular salary as their income can vary from month to month. 
        Though you may earn more most often but remember that there may be lean periods when work is scarce. 
        This can be both a blessing and a curse as you get to learn much stuffs about handeling your income.</p></li>
    <li><p>As this isn't a traditional job, you need to be self-motivated in order to get
         your work done. You may feel frustating as your works can be hours long and challenging, but this is the 
         real & best experience of being a freelancer.

    <li><p>Time is the key to success in freelancing. You need to be responsible for managing your own time,
         A freelancer need to be good at organizing their work and prioritizing tasks. Not only work, enjoying 
        your life with family members is as important as working. </p></li>
