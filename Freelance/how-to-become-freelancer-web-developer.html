            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>Freedom To Work Independently: The major reason to choose freelancing is letting yourself
                        choose
                        your own working category independently. If you feel uncomfortable with the clients and
                        the type
                        of
                        project, you can leave whenever you want. This not only helps you do the works you are
                        interested in but
                        also encourages you to work more for the client from your sub-conscious mind. This helps
                        you get
                        less
                        stress if compared to other corporate jobs, where you can't work in freedom.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Flexible working Time: This is another perk of freelancing where you can work anytime you
                        want.
                        You can work irrespective of your location, either while travelling or at home. There's
                        no one
                        who will force you to work on the exact time they want. You don't need to work 9-5 in a
                        fixed
                        place all the time.
                        . Flexible working time helps you to work on several projects at the same time which
                        increases
                        your revenue
                        and helps to understand the importance of time management.</p>
                </li>

                    <p>Control over workload: Freedom to work independently and flexible working time helps you
                        to focus
                        on your goals and completion of the projects in no time. Freelancing helps you to
                        control over
                        your workload,
                        this helps you develop both physically and mentally for the work. When there's no
                        workload and
                        everything
                        is upon yourself, then the productivity increases. Increase in productivity is directly
                        proportional to
                        check in balance between work and client's relationships.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Earning potential: When you become a professional web developer then you can charge more
                        for the
                        work

                        jobs.

                        you can work on your own projects and market and sell it. Plenty of opportunities arise
                        once you
                        become a
                        good freelancer. You can start your own youtube channels and social medias and share
                        your ideas

                        This helps you as an extra source of income without any kind of mental pressure.
                    </p>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>There are more perks like professional growth, diverse range of experience, location independence
                and

            <h2 id="head-ahref8"class="heading2">Drawbacks of Being Freelance Web Developer</h2>
            <p>Though we talked about the advantages of being a freelance web developer, there are many
                drawbacks of
                having such profession.
                They are listed below:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>Busy Shedule: Freelancers are fully responsible for finding their own clients and
                        projects all
                        the time,
                        which can be time-consuming and requires a lot of efforts too. This can lead to a busy
                        schedule,
                        as freelancers may have to work on multiple projects simultaneously in order to make a
                        living.
                        Because of these
                        they may get less time to enjoy as they need to complete the project to earn some money.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Financially Unstable: As Freelancing isn't a monthly salary basis job, you need to keep
                        working
                        to
                        earn some income. Sometimes you may spend your money on other stuffs and may have no
                        money left.
                        In that case,
                        it is kindof difficult for you to manage the money. In order to start earning, you must
                        complete
                        the projects
                        which may create instability in financial condition of a freelancer.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>No protection from unemployment: You clearly know that a freelancer may loose his
                        interest
                        anytime if
                        he/she doesn't love his works. If you're not passionate about freelancing then you
                        shouldn't
                        start doing it.
                        One can be feel like unemployed if didn't get any clients ready to work with them.
                        There's no
                        any pansion
                        of being a freelancer. Your success fully depends on your work.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>No paid vacation or sick leave: If you are travelling person then freelancing can be both
                        boon
                        and curse
                        at the same time. This is because your sub-conscious mind gets distracted whenever you
                        try to
                        enjoy and
                        work. You need to balance both the works at the same time. There's no any leave in
                        freelancing.
                        If you
                        work less, you earn less. But if you think health is your true wealth and rest taking
                        some leave
                        from work
                        then its upon you to check whether its good or bad decision.
                    </p>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p> As every coin has two sides, Freelancing is no far betrayed from this truth. If you work in this
                field
                wholeheartedly and
                want to achieve something then this can be a good option. But for those who are doing without
                interest
                may
                live like a rose covered in thrones. By the way, freelancing is both good and bad option to
                choose.

            <p>Freelancing as a job will enable you to execute projects with complete creative control.
                This modern work style allows you to be selective about the projects you take on.
                Though you may be excellent in web development but you must possess a blend of technical, and
                business skills. These features inside you will help you work in a profitable environment as a
                freelancer.
                Being equipped with such skills will definitely help you to gain potential clients and you can
                offer
                your services accordingly. </p>
            <p>Demand of the market keeps changing, so you need to make sure that your skills are getting
                updated with
                time. A freelancer must update himself to stand one step ahead of his competitors and reach
                maximum
                clients possible.
                The more diverse your skills get , the more likely it is that clients will prefer you over
                others.
