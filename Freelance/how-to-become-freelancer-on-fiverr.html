            <br>

            <p>Freelancing is a type of work model in which people offer their services to clients on a
                project-by-project
                basis but not being employed by a single company or boss. Freelancers are self-employed individuals who
                are responsible for finding their own clients, negotiating terms and rates, and managing their own
                finances.
            </p>
            <p>In other words, Freelancers aren't bound by any sorts of traditional employment agreements & have the
                freedom to
                choose their own projects they want to work on and whenever they want. They may work from anywhere &
                have the ability to
                set their own schedules. However, Freelancing can be risky as this independence also means that
                freelancers are responsible for
                their own benefits, such as healthcare and retirement savings, and must continuously find new clients
                and projects to maintain a balanced source of revenue. <a
