            <p>Web hosting is the process of storing and serving the files that make up a website so that it can be
                accessed on the internet. Essentially, web hosting is like renting space on a server (a powerful
                computer) that is always connected to the internet. When someone types in your website's address, their
                device connects to the server and downloads the website's files, which are then displayed in their web
                browser.</p>
            <p>Web hosting is an essential component of building a website, as it determines how quickly and reliably
                your website loads, how much traffic it can handle, and how secure it is. There are many different types
                of web hosting available, ranging from shared hosting (where multiple websites share the same server) to
                dedicated hosting (where you have an entire server to yourself). The type of hosting you choose will
                depend on your budget, the size and complexity of your website, and your technical expertise.

            <p>When it comes to creating a website, choosing the right web hosting provider is crucial.
                A good hosting provider can ensure that your website is fast, reliable, and secure, while a poor
                hosting provider can result in slow load times, frequent downtime, and security vulnerabilities.
            </p>
            <p>There are many web hosting platforms/services available, ranging from small independent providers
                to large corporations like Amazon and Microsoft. Each platform/service offers different features,
                pricing, and levels of technical support, so it's important to choose a provider that meets your
                specific needs.</p>
            <p>Before choosing a web hosting provider, consider factors like the size and complexity of your
                website, your budget, and your level of technical expertise. Additionally, read reviews and
                compare different providers to ensure that you choose a reliable and trustworthy hosting
                option for your website.</p>

                    class="imgA"></a>
            <p>GitHub is a website that helps developers work together on projects. When people are working
                on a software project, they need to keep track of all the changes they make to the code
                . This is called "version control". GitHub makes it easy to do version control and also lets
                developers share their code with others. This is really useful because it means that other
                developers can see what you've done and give you feedback or even help you improve the code.
            </p>
            <p>Moreover, GitHub also offers a web hosting service, called GitHub Pages, that allows users to host their
                website directly from their GitHub repository. In this article, We've included various aspects of GitHub
                as well
                as web hosting. We hope, you'll find this article praiseworthy.

            <p>Yes, You can easily host your static website on github. GitHub Pages is a static website hosting service
                that lets you create and host a website directly from your GitHub repository. This means that you
                can store all of your website files in your repository, and GitHub will automatically build and
                publish your website whenever you make changes to your code.</p>
            <p>One of the biggest benefits of using GitHub Pages for web hosting is that it's completely free.
                You don't need to pay for hosting or domain registration, and there are no limits on bandwidth
                or storage. This makes it a great option for developers who are just starting out or who want
                to host a simple website without spending a lot of money.</p>
            <p>GitHub Pages also supports custom domains, so you can use your own domain name instead of the
                default GitHub Pages URL. This is great for creating a more professional-looking website and
                for building your brand.</p>
            <p>However, it's important to note that GitHub Pages is best suited for hosting static websites,
                which means websites that don't have any dynamic content or server-side processing.
                If your website requires server-side processing, you may need to use a different web
                hosting service.

            <P>You can easily upload your files and folders using Drag & Drop method on GitHub and
                use GitHub as your FREE LifeTime Hosting Platform. Before that you'll need to have a domain

            <p>DOMAIN -> CLOUDFLARE ->  GITHUB</p>
            <p id="what-is-cloudflare">Basically we're going to use GitHub for our hosting. But We can't directly connect our
                domain name with GitHub. In this scenerio, CloudFlare comes in. This is because to
                use a custom domain name with your GitHub Pages website, you need to set up DNS records
                that point to GitHub's servers. You can take advantage of CloudFlare's DNS management
                features, as well as their caching and security features, while still being able
                to host your website on GitHub Pages.

            <p>Follow The Following Steps To Understand The Full Setup Process.

                <li class="steps">STEP-3: Now, You need to create an account on CloudFlare. Enter your email and password and signup a new 
                    account. Now, we're going to head towards CloudFlare's Dashboard.

                </li>
                <li class="steps">STEP-4: Simply Click on the first option as shown in the picture below. Next, You'll need to 
                    add the domain name in the (Add Site) form.

                </li>
                <li class="steps">STEP-6: Now You'll need to have a DNS Management Setup. This is what CloudFlare is 
                    for. Copy everything mentioned in the picture below. DNS management in Cloudflare refers
                     to the ability to manage the Domain Name System (DNS) records associated with your
                      domain name. DNS records are used to map domain names to IP addresses, allowing
                       visitors to access your website by entering a domain name in their browser.
                       <img src="Assets/pic14.JPG" alt="DNS management in cloudflare">
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>That's It. Congrats, You've Successfully created DNS Management Setup for your domain name. 
                You'll need to wait for about 1,2 for it to technically work. Now, in that mean time, we can 
                setup our GitHub account and connect to CloudFlare.

    in your website. This is an easy process. After CloudFlare and GitHub setup, you'll be 
    able to upload any HTML, CSS AND JS projects, especially Frontend in your website. Follow the following steps:

        (Add File) and Drag and Drop the files and Click on the (Commit Changes) button.
