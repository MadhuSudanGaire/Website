            <p> Studying Computer Engineering in bachelors education helps to produce skilled human resources who can
                help in the
                development of Nepal’s technological aspect. The degree of computer engineering is respected all over
                the world
                and students can study their masters even in foreign countries as well.

            <h2 id="head-ahref8">Eligibility criteria to Study Bachelor of Computer Engineering in Nepal</h2>
            <p>For those who wish to study computer engineering program in TU colleges,
                need to be meet certain criterias as mentioned below:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Students must have passed Intermediate Level/ +2 in Science with mathematics as a
                    subject with a minimum of 45%. </li>
                <li>Students must have appeared on the IOE Entrance examination and secured a minimum of
                    40% (which is a passing score). Students must bring a minimum of 40% to study
                    any engineering at TU run engineering institutes. </li>

            <h2 id="head-ahref9">IOE Entrance Exammination</h2>
            <p>The widely known IOE entrance examination in Nepal is taken in an yearly basis in which thousands of
                students apply in order to study computer engineering courses within Nepal.
                The entrance exam questions are taken from 5 subjects - Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry, English and
                Engineering Aptitude. </p>
            <p>At past students had to give the exam on papers but now they've to submit their
                entrance questions in computers. For this, students need to be prepared both physically and mentally.
            </p>
            <p>If you want to prepare before the IOE entrance exams, then different institutes like PEA and
                SEA offer Engineering preparation courses. These courses are of 3 months to 1 year long. These courses
                cost from NPR 12,000 to NPR 25,000 depending upon the length of the engineering preparation course and
                institute you choose. </p>
            <h2 id="head-ahref10">Scopes of Computer Engineering in Nepal</h2>
            <p>Computer Engineering is one of the highest-paid professions in Nepal.
                The computer engineering graduates can earn money ranging from NPR 20,000 per month for freshers to NPR
                2
                Lakhs per month. The salary depends on the work experience, skills of the graduates.
                They can find jobs in IT companies, data companies, health sectors,
                education sectors, and so on. There are various governmental IT related jobs where a computer
                engineering graduate
                can apply. Other than those governmental organizations, there are a number of private companies
                offering jobs for computer engineers. </p>

            <h2 id="head-ahref11">FEE Structures of Computer Engineering Course</h2>
            <p>The cost of studying Computer Engineering in Nepal differs from college to college.
                For the government engineering college to Constituent campus of TU like Pulchowk campus,
                Thapathali Campus, WRC, and ERC, the tuition fee of Bachelor of Computer Engineering is the same.
                For the regular students (regular students means the students who are fully funded), the cost is
                just about NPR 15,000 for 4 years of Study. For the paying students, the fees as about Npr 2,80,000
                for 4 years of study. </p>
            <p>Likewise, for the private engineering colleges affiliated with TU, the fee structure of computer
                engineering ranges from NPR 8 Lakhs to NPR 13 Lakhs for 4 years of study.

                For engineering colleges affiliated with Pokhara University and Purbanchal University, the tuition fees
                range from NPR 6 Lakhs to NPR 10 Lakhs for the total course.
            </p>
        <p> Finally, the bachelor of computer engineering in KU costs about NPR 6 Lakhs for 4 years of study.

                Computer Engineering courses in Nepal comes with decent scholarships. The topper of Each Computer
                Engineering is waived off entire tuition fees. Additionally, other than the topper as well, some of the
                best performers of the class are partially waived off the tuition fees depending on the provision of
                college.
            </p>

<p>Both CSIT and Computer Engineering hold their own potential to generate skillful students. Those who prefer 
    learning softwares and without any burden of additional theories, can choose CSIT as their primary option. 
    And those who want to study hardwares or software can choose Computer Engineering. Computer Engineering 
    is comparatively more tough than CSIT as it includes additional theoritical informations. Computer Engineer 
    graduates can hold more potential of gaining governmental jobs than CSIT graduates. But in today's technical 
    world, skills play significant role rather than just a degree.
</p>
<p>After pursuing any of them, a student will be able to solve technical problems. He/she can work as freelancer if 
    possesses some skills along with the knowledge. These degrees increase the possibilites of getting more opportunities 
    as an IT professional in the future. Pursuing skills as well knowledge from CSIT or Computer Engineering should 
    be the major priorities to become a successful IT personnel.
