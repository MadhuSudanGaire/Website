            <h2>Some Surprising & Shocking Facts about Tourism Industry WorldWide</h2>
            <hr><br><br>
            <p>Tourism is a significant industry that involves the movement of people to destinations outside their
                normal place of work and residence, typically for leisure or business purposes. It includes a wide range
                of activities such as travel, transportation, accommodation, entertainment, and food and beverage
                service, and can generate significant economic, social, cultural, and environmental impacts on a
                destination.
            </p>
            <p> At the global level, tourism is a major contributor to the global economy, with the World Travel &
                Tourism Council (WTTC) estimating that in 2020, the travel and tourism industry contributed
                approximately 9.3% of the global gross domestic product (GDP). International tourism generates billions
                of dollars in income for destinations around the world, with the United Nations World Tourism
                Organization (UNWTO) reporting that international tourism receipts reached $1.5 trillion in 2019.

            <p> However, the COVID-19 pandemic had had a significant impact on the tourism industry, resulting in
                significant disruptions and reductions in travel. Slowly & gradually tourism industry has began to
                reflourish again,
                People've began travelling with the same pace as before the covid time. People seem to be much more
                confident about travelling & exploring the places.</p>
