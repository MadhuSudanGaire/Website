         <h2>Make your website stand out with side rail ads</h2>
          <p>
            Side rail ads are a type of advertising format that is commonly used by Google AdSense.
             These ads are typically placed along the side rail of a website,
              hence the name "side rail ads."
          Side rail ads are a popular choice for many advertisers because they are highly visible and 
            can be effective in driving traffic to a website. These ads are typically used to promote
             products or services that are related to the content on the website where the ad is being
              displayed.  </p>
            
            <p>   One of the key advantages of side rail ads is their ability to target a specific audience.
                 Advertisers can use Google AdSense to target their ads to specific demographics, interests,

             the chances of generating leads.  </p>
