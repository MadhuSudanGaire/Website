         <h2>Make your website stand out with side rail ads</h2>
          <p>
            Side rail ads are a type of advertising format that is commonly used by Google AdSense.
             These ads are typically placed along the side rail of a website,
              hence the name "side rail ads."
          Side rail ads are a popular choice for many advertisers because they are highly visible and 
            can be effective in driving traffic to a website. These ads are typically used to promote
             products or services that are related to the content on the website where the ad is being
              displayed.  </p>
            
            <p>   One of the key advantages of side rail ads is their ability to target a specific audience.
                 Advertisers can use Google AdSense to target their ads to specific demographics, interests,
                  and locations. This allows advertisers to reach their target audience more effectively and
                   increase the chances of their ads being seen by potential customers.  Another key benefit of side rail ads is their ability to drive engagement. These ads are

             encourage them to click on the ad. This can help drive traffic to a website and increase 
             the chances of generating leads.  </p>
